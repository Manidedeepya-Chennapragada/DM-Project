# Style Transfer Of T1 and T2 MRI Images Using Cycle GAN and Dual GAN
#### This repository contains the code and resources for performing style transfer on T1 and T2 MRI images using Cycle GAN and Dual GAN models.

## Overview
#### Style transfer is a technique that allows us to apply the visual style of one image (the style image) to another image (the content image), resulting in a new image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image. In this project, we focus on applying style transfer techniques specifically to T1 and T2 MRI images, which are commonly used in medical imaging.

#### We use Cycle GAN (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks) and Dual GAN (Dual-Generator Generative Adversarial Networks) architectures to perform the style transfer. These models have shown promising results in image-to-image translation tasks and are well-suited for our task of transferring styles between MRI images.
